<h1>Terms of Service</h1>

<h4>Last updated: October 16, 2022</h4>

<p>Thank you for choosing Nitehub! Before you use it, please read this Terms of Service agreement carefully, which contains an important contract between us and our users.</p>

<h2>Definitions</h2>

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with Nitehub. A “User Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on Nitehub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A User Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.

 2. The "Agreement" collectively refers to all terms, conditions, and notices referenced or contained in this document and other operating rules, policies (including Privacy Policy) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on this Website.

 3. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.

 4. "Nitehub", "We", and "Us" refers to Nitehub, as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.

 5. The "Service" refers to applications/software, products, and services provided by Nitehub.

 6. The "User", "You", and "Your" refers to an individual person or institution (organizations or company) that has visited or is using the Service; that has access to or can use any part of the Account; or that directs or uses the Account to perform its function. Please note that additional terms may apply for Accounts related to businesses or governments.

 7. The "Website" refers to Nitehub's website at <a href="https://git.c-eo.repl.co">git.c-eo.repl.co</a>, including its subdomains and other websites owned by Nitehub.
   

<h2>Account Terms</h2>

<h3>Account Controls</h3>

1. <b>Users:</b> Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your User Account and the Content within it.

2. <b>Organizations:</b> The <em>"owner"</em> of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one User Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.
   

<h3>Required Information</h3>

<p>You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we may need more information about the legal entity).</p>

<h3>Account Requirements</h3>

  <ul>
   <li>You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit "machine accounts" though.</li>
   <li>A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions.</li>
   <li>You must be age 13 or older. If we learn of any User under that age, we will immediately terminate that User's Account. Different countries may have a different minimum age requirement for you to legally be bound by these Terms; in such cases you are responsible for complying with your country's regulation. By using Nitehub, you agree to comply with the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rules/rulemaking-regulatory-reform-proceedings/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule">COPPA</a> and/or similar law(s) in your country.</li>
  </ul>

<h3>User Account Security</h3>

<p>You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication (2FA) to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.</p>

<h3>Additional Terms</h3>

<p>In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of Nitehub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on Nitehub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with Nitehub; or you may use Nitehub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.</p>

<h2>Acceptable Use</h2>

<p>Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws (international or local), including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with the laws and any applicable regulations.</p>

<h2>User-Generated Content</h2>

1. You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content, and for any harm resulting from any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

2. We do not pre-screen User-Generated Content, but we have the right (though not the obligation) to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any of our terms or policies.

<h3>Please note:</h3>

<p>You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.</p>

<p>Because of the above, we need you to grant us -- and other Nitehub users -- certain legal permissions, listed below in this section. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting Nitehub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted below. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.</p>
    
<p>We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service. This includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.</p>

<p>This license, however, doesn't grant Nitehub the right to sell Your Content or otherwise distribute or use it outside of our provision of the Service.</p>
    
<p>Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).</p>

<p>If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of Nitehub a non-exclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the Nitehub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on Nitehub as permitted through Nitehub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you adopt a license. If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other Nitehub Users.</p>
    
<p>Whenever you make a contribution to a repository containing a notice of a license, you license your contribution under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license your contribution under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license your contributions under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.</p>

<p><i>Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.</i></p>
    
<p>You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted above, but not otherwise.</p>

<p>To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant Nitehub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.</p>
    
<h2>Private Repositories</h2>

1. Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

2. Nitehub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. Nitehub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.
  
3. <p>Nitehub employees may only access the content of your private repositories in the following situations:</p>

     <ul>
      <li>With your consent and knowledge, for support reasons. If Nitehub accesses a private repository for support reasons, we will only do so with the owner’s consent and knowledge.</li>
      <li>When access is required for security reasons, including when access is required to maintain ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of Nitehub's systems and Service.</li>
     </ul>
  </li>

4. You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example: You may enable various Nitehub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but Nitehub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the Nitehub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

  <h2>API Terms</h2>

  <p>Abuse or excessively frequent requests to Nitehub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. Nitehub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.</p>

  <p>You may not share API tokens to exceed Nitehub's rate limitations.</p>

  <p>You may not use the API to download data or Content from Nitehub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling Nitehub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.</p>

  <h2>Cancellation and Termination</h2>

   <h3>Account Cancellation</h3>

   <p>It is your responsibility to properly cancel your Account with Nitehub.

   <h3>Upon Cancellation</h3>

   <p>We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile and the Content of your repositories within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information can not be recovered once your Account is cancelled.</p>

   <p>We will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users' repositories or that other Users have forked.</p>

   <p>Upon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an Account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing Account contents after Account cancellation or termination. You must make this request within 90 days of cancellation or termination.</p>
